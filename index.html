            <p>I was able to move away from my back pain medication in a safe, non-addictive way by using this app. I would recommend this app to anyone who is looking into cannabis as a means to help with their pain or cronic illness

            <p>Using this app allowed me to find the right dosage for my son to helped him  with his tourettes. He's now able to go about his day without having to worry about his ticks. Thank you Med Cabinent for this. This is a complete life changer.
